# Flow: Programmer

## Goal
Implement a feature or system change with clean code, tests, and documentation.

## Discovery prompts
- What is the feature and who needs it?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What existing code areas are impacted?
- What constraints exist (performance, security, compatibility)?
- What is the expected rollout strategy?

## Required artifacts
- `requirement.md` with scope and constraints
- `functional-spec.md` for behavior and edge cases
- `technical-spec.md` for design and dependencies
- `architecture.md` for component-level impact
- `test-plan.md` for coverage and regression

## Risk and compliance
- Regression risk on critical flows
- Backward compatibility
- Operational impacts

## Acceptance criteria examples
- Feature works in primary and edge scenarios.
- Tests cover new logic and critical regressions.
- Documentation updated for users and developers.

## Recommended outputs
- Implementation plan
- Code review checklist
- Rollout plan
