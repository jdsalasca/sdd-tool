# Flow: PR review (code review)

## Goal
Resolve pull request feedback with high confidence, clean changes, and documented decisions.

## Discovery prompts
- What repository and PR link should be reviewed?
- What is the target branch and scope of the PR?
- Are there blocking comments or requested changes?
- What tests or checks are required?
- Are there deadlines or merge constraints?

## Required artifacts
- `requirement.md` with review objectives
- `functional-spec.md` summarizing behavior expectations
- `technical-spec.md` with planned fixes
- `test-plan.md` covering affected areas
- `progress-log.md` for review status

## Risk and compliance
- Regression risk from changes
- Breaking API or behavior changes
- Incomplete test coverage

## Acceptance criteria examples
- All review comments addressed or resolved.
- Changes validated by tests or checks.
- Summary of changes posted back to PR.

## Recommended outputs
- Review checklist
- Change summary for PR comments
- Verified test results
