# Flow: Graphic design

## Goal
Deliver a visual system (brand, UI, or campaign) with clear requirements and critique loops.

## Discovery prompts
- What is the brand or message?
- Who is the audience and context?
- What formats are required (logo, web, print, social)?
- What references or style directions exist?
- What are the constraints (budget, timeline, tools)?

## Required artifacts
- `requirement.md` with audience and goals
- `functional-spec.md` for usage scenarios
- `technical-spec.md` for file formats and delivery specs
- `architecture.md` for design system structure
- `test-plan.md` for accessibility and brand consistency checks

## Risk and compliance
- Trademark conflicts
- Accessibility and contrast compliance
- Usage inconsistency across channels

## Acceptance criteria examples
- Color palette meets contrast ratios.
- Logo works at small and large sizes.
- Deliverables match required formats.

## Recommended outputs
- Brand guidelines
- Component library
- Asset delivery checklist
