# Flow: Teacher (education)

## Goal
Create a system for lesson planning, assessments, and feedback with clear learning outcomes.

## Discovery prompts
- What grade levels and subjects are supported?
- What is the grading model (rubrics, points, mastery)?
- How are students and guardians notified?
- Are there accessibility requirements?
- What data privacy rules apply to students?

## Required artifacts
- `requirement.md` with learning objectives and scope
- `functional-spec.md` covering lesson, assignment, and grading flows
- `technical-spec.md` for integrations (LMS, email, calendars)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for content storage and versioning
- `test-plan.md` with grading accuracy and accessibility checks

## Risk and compliance
- Student data privacy
- Accessibility standards
- Content versioning and auditability

## Acceptance criteria examples
- Teachers can reuse and version lessons.
- Students receive feedback within configured SLAs.
- Accessibility checks are enforced for uploaded content.

## Recommended outputs
- Lesson plan templates
- Grading rubric engine
- Student progress analytics
