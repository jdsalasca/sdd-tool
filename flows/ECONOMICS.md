## Goal
Analyze economic scenarios or policy impacts with clear assumptions and models.

## Discovery prompts
- What policy or market question is being analyzed?
- What scope and geography are covered?
- What time horizon is relevant?
- What data sources or models are required?
- What stakeholders need the results?

## Required artifacts
- `requirement.md` with objectives and constraints
- `functional-spec.md` for analysis flow and outputs
- `technical-spec.md` for models and datasets
- `architecture.md` for data pipeline and reporting
- `test-plan.md` for sensitivity and robustness checks

## Risk and compliance
- Model assumptions and bias
- Data quality issues
- Overconfidence in forecasts

## Acceptance criteria examples
- Assumptions are explicit and defensible.
- Sensitivity analysis is included.
- Results are reproducible.

## Recommended outputs
- Assumptions log
- Scenario matrix
- Executive summary
