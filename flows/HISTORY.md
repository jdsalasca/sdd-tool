# Flow: History research

## Goal
Produce a credible historical analysis with sources, timelines, and context.

## Discovery prompts
- What period or region is in scope?
- What is the research question or thesis?
- What depth is required (overview vs academic)?
- What sources are allowed or preferred?
- What format is required (essay, lecture, timeline)?

## Required artifacts
- `requirement.md` with scope and thesis
- `functional-spec.md` for narrative flow
- `technical-spec.md` for citation style and source rules
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for section structure
- `test-plan.md` for source verification and bias checks

## Risk and compliance

- Misinterpretation of primary sources
- Citation or attribution mistakes

## Acceptance criteria examples
- Claims are supported by sources.
- Timeline is consistent and verifiable.
- Multiple perspectives are represented.

## Recommended outputs
