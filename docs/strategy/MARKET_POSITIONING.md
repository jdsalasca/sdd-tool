# Market Positioning

## Positioning Statement

`sdd-cli` is an AI-orchestrated delivery engine for teams that need to move from idea to production-ready software with strict quality controls, without manually coordinating every step.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

- Small and medium product teams shipping weekly.
- Agencies and consultancies delivering multiple client apps.
- Internal platform teams standardizing project delivery quality.

## Primary Jobs-To-Be-Done

- Turn vague product requests into actionable delivery artifacts fast.
- Generate implementation-ready projects while preserving quality gates.
- Reduce rework caused by weak requirements and inconsistent execution.

## Differentiation

- Full lifecycle orchestration from discovery to publish.
- Provider-agnostic execution (Gemini default, Codex optional).
- Strict acceptance gates (tests, docs, schemas, regression evidence).
- Traceability across requirement, architecture, implementation, and release.

## Core Value Pillars

- Speed: first working baseline in minutes.
- Reliability: delivery blocked until quality criteria pass.
- Consistency: repeatable workflow across project types.
- Control: configuration for workspace, provider, model, and publish mode.

## Messaging Framework

- Headline: "From product goal to production-ready software, with quality gates."
- Supporting line: "sdd-cli orchestrates planning, generation, validation, and publishing so teams ship faster with less rework."
- Proof points:
  - single-command entry (`sdd-tool "<goal>"`)
  - structured artifacts and lifecycle report
  - automated quality and Git/GitHub handoff

## Competitive Framing

- Against "raw AI coding": adds orchestration, recovery loops, and hard quality gates.
- Against "template generators": supports iterative, intent-driven, provider-backed execution.
- Against "manual PM + engineering flow": compresses planning and execution cycle time.

## Go-To-Market Motions (Near-Term)

- Developer-led onboarding via npm + "first result in 5 minutes" path.
- Content-led trust via reproducible examples and lifecycle reports.
- Team adoption via config defaults and monorepo scope support.

## Success Metrics

- Time-to-first-value under 5 minutes.
- Hello-to-finish completion rate.
- Week-4 project retention.
- Share of runs passing strict quality gates without manual intervention.
