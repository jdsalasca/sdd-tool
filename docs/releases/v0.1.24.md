# Release Notes (v0.1.24)

## Highlights
- Gemini-first orchestration path hardened: `hello` now enforces strict lifecycle gates and blocks completion when quality checks fail.
- New intent-alignment quality gate reduces false-positive "successful" deliveries that do not match the requested app objective.
- GitHub publish metadata generation now derives from project and goal context for cleaner repo names/descriptions.
- Added configurable AI model default via `config.yml` (`ai.model`) and CLI wiring (`--model`).

## Quality and validation
- Added lifecycle-focused tests for intent alignment and metadata derivation.
- Kept full local test suite green before release.

## Notes
- Default workspace remains `~/Documents/sdd-tool-projects` (example on Windows: `C:\Users\jdsal\Documents\sdd-tool-projects`).
- Default provider remains `gemini`; GitHub publish remains opt-in via `git.publish_enabled=true`.
