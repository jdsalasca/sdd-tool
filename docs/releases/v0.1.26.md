# Release Notes (v0.1.26)

## Highlights
- Quality hardening for Java + React generations:
  - enforce DTO package and `*Dto.java` usage
  - enforce service/repository interfaces
  - enforce at least one Java `record`
  - enforce frontend architecture layers (`src/api`, `src/hooks/use*`, `src/components`)
  - enforce frontend test baseline in fullstack profile
- Relational-domain hardening:
  - require `schema.sql` (or SQL migration files)
  - require explicit DB technology declaration (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MariaDB/SQLite) in docs/schemas
- Lifecycle reliability:
  - run backend/frontend checks as part of quality gate
  - fix Windows Maven resolution (`mvn.cmd`)
  - improve diagnostic capture for process spawn failures
- AI repair improvements:
  - compact quality diagnostics to reduce prompt overload
  - add minimal patch fallback prompt for targeted fixes

## Outcome
- Generated projects that do not meet architecture and quality standards are now blocked more aggressively before publish.
- The orchestrator iterates with stricter, clearer diagnostics instead of accepting structurally weak output.
