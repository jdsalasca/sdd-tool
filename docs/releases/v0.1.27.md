# Release Notes (v0.1.27)

## Highlights
- New strict architecture profile for Java + React quality:
  - enforce DTO package and `*Dto.java` artifacts
  - enforce service/repository interfaces
  - enforce `record` usage in backend model transport
  - enforce global error handling (`@RestControllerAdvice`)
  - enforce validation with `jakarta/javax.validation` and `@Valid`
  - enforce backend dependencies for production quality (`lombok`, validation, actuator)
  - enforce telemetry-ready backend configuration (actuator/prometheus style settings)
  - enforce frontend architecture layers (`src/api`, `src/hooks/use*`, `src/components`)
  - enforce frontend StrictMode and minimum frontend tests

## Orchestration and reliability
- Lifecycle checks now produce stronger rejection signals for weak generated code before publish.
- Repo naming now favors intent-derived terms for clearer project identity in GitHub.
- Improved process failure capture and Windows command handling in lifecycle checks.

## Outcome
- `sdd-tool` is stricter as an orchestrator: it blocks low-quality Java+React outputs and forces iterative repair attempts instead of accepting weak deliveries.
