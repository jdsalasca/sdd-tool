# Release Notes (v0.1.25)

## Highlights
- Documentation refactor: strategy and adoption artifacts moved under `docs/strategy/`.
- Added `docs/strategy/MARKET_POSITIONING.md` to sharpen messaging and go-to-market direction.
- README reduced to a focused npm-first guide (what it does, fast start, config, flags, and where to go deeper).
- NPM publish workflow now triggers on `v*` tag pushes as well as release/manual events.

## Documentation map updates
- New index for strategy assets: `docs/strategy/README.md`.
- Updated `docs/INDEX.md` to include the new strategy section and paths.

## Notes
- No runtime behavior changes in CLI orchestration logic.
- This release improves packaging clarity, discoverability, and market positioning readiness.
