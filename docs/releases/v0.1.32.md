# Release v0.1.32

Date: 2026-02-08

## Highlights
- Enforce deeper runtime quality in lifecycle validation:
  - API-like apps must include executable smoke scripts (`smoke`/`test:smoke`/`e2e`).
  - API-like apps must include curl/local endpoint verification evidence.
  - lifecycle baseline now expects at least 8 automated tests.
- Strengthen digital reviewer acceptance criteria:
  - reviewer QA requires at least 10 tests.
  - reviewer QA requires smoke verification evidence.
- Keep value delivery moving across all rounds:
  - if base quality passes early, additional `--iterations` rounds still generate value-growth stories and force revalidation.

## Validation
- `npm run build`
- `npm test` (81 passing)
- `npm run check:docs`
- `npm run verify:publish`
