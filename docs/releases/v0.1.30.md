# Release v0.1.30

Date: 2026-02-08

## Highlights
- Expand digital test personas across product and delivery dimensions:
  - PM, QA, UX, accessibility, performance, support, integrator, release manager, security.
- Convert reviewer findings into prioritized user stories (`P0`/`P1`) for implementation loops.
- Persist digital user-story backlog artifacts:
  - `deploy/digital-review-user-stories.json`
  - `deploy/digital-review-user-stories.md`
- Feed generated user stories back into Gemini refinement prompts during `hello` lifecycle retries.

## Validation
- `npm run build`
- `npm test` (79 passing)
- `npm run check:docs`
- `npm run verify:publish`

## Notes
- This release improves the “review -> stories -> implement -> re-review” cycle so outputs converge faster toward production-readiness.
