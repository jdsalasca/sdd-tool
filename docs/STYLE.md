# Documentation Style

## File naming
- Use uppercase filenames for docs (`PROCESS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- Place reports under `docs/reports/`.

## Structure
- Start with a one-line purpose statement.
- Use `##` headings for major sections.
- Keep lists short and actionable.

## Links
- Prefer relative paths (`docs/INDEX.md`).
- Use `sdd-cli` for CLI examples and references.

## Content rules
- Avoid duplicated lists; link to a single source of truth.
- Keep examples minimal and consistent with current CLI behavior.
