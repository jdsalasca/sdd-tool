# Vision

Create a universal, multi-domain AI framework that guides people from questions to outcomes.

The end state:
- One command to start, one workflow to finish.
- A system that learns the user, adapts to their domain, and never skips critical questions.
- A standard of quality that works across code, research, design, and policy.
- A workspace that is clean, versioned, and designed for collaboration.
- AI with wings: guided, constrained, and verified at every step.
