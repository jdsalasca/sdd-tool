# Flow compliance checklist

This merges coverage, gates, and templates into a single readiness view.

## Checks
- Flow exists in `router/` and `flows/`
- Flow is listed in `FLOW_COVERAGE.md`
- Flow maps to templates in `FLOW_TEMPLATE_MAP.md`
- Flow maps to gates in `FLOW_GATE_MAP.md`
- Templates exist in `templates/`
- Prompt packs exist and cover gates
